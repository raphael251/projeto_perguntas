# projeto_perguntas (questions_project)

The first project in the Flutter course, where I've learned the basics principles about the behavior of this framework. I also learned about stateless and stateful widgets and some Dart particularities, like how public and private properties work.

This app is a simple quiz that has some options for each question and each option has a number of points. In the final, the score will determine the phrase showed for the user and a button to restart the quiz.  

If you're interested in learning how to create Flutter apps, I recommend the course that I'm doing from Leonardo Leit√£o. [Here](https://www.udemy.com/course/curso-flutter/) is the link.
