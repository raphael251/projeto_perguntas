# projeto_perguntas (questions_project)

The first project in the Flutter course, where I've learned the basics principles about the behavior of this framewor. I also learned about stateless and stateful widgets and some Dart particularities, like how public and private properties work.

If you're interested in learning how to create Flutter apps, I recommend the course that I'm doing from Leonardo Leit√£o. [Here](https://www.udemy.com/course/curso-flutter/) is the link.
